# Arithmos

This repository is a branching off of [Arithmetic Explorer
(2001-10-08)](https://archive.org/details/tucows_271898_Arithmetic_Explorer_arithmos)
developed by the Computer Arithmetic & Numerical Techniques (CANT) research
group at the University of Antwerp at the time. To the best of my knowledge,
this software is no longer being worked on otherwise.

## Starting Point

[arexp-linux.tar.gz](https://archive.org/download/tucows_271898_Arithmetic_Explorer_arithmos/arexp-linux.tar.gz)
with SHA256 sum
