Root-finding</H1>
Motivating examples for this subject are:
<UL>
<LI>
the implementation on a chip of a routine to compute the square root</LI>

<LI>
the difficult problem of polynomial root solving [<A HREF="node14.html#posso1996">2</A>,<A HREF="node14.html#frisco1996">1</A>]</LI>
</UL>
In contrast to the ``Linear Algebra" module, the methods that are discussed
here are iterative, and hence non-exact: bisection, Newton's method and
regula falsi. These are fairly general purpose methods, in the sense that
not too stringent requirements are imposed on the function of which the
roots must be computed. For the implementation of the different methods,
the students are asked to estimate the root-solving problem graphically
and to determine starting-points for the iterative method from the graph.
In this way, they confront the problem of reliable graphical output. Several
non-linear equations resulting from real-life problems are given as projects.
