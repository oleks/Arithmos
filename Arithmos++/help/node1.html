Scientific Computing for the CS-student</H1>
The course ``Computer Arithmetic and Numerical Techniques" at the University
of Antwerp, is an introductory scientific computing course for students
with a major in computer science or a combined major mathematics/computer
science. But it could as well be taught to any exact or applied science
student with a reasonable highschool background in mathematics and a fair
interest in computers. It is this growing group of science students interested
in computer science that we are trying to encourage into scientific computing.
When the idea to set up a special course for computer science students
was first launched in 1993 -- it is by the way often hard to get computer
science students interested in scientific computing -- many colleagues
world-wide reacted very enthusiastically.
<P>Unlike engineering students, CS-students are rarely confronted with
real-life scientific computing problems in other courses. Yet we believe
that the best approach to a scientific computing course is one where the
complete journey is followed from physical problem to computational solution,
as described in [<A HREF="node14.html#Mar95">5</A>]. The basic steps in
this journey are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
1.</DT>

<DD>
a motivating problem</DD>

<DT>
2.</DT>

<DD>
the identification of the computational problem behind the given real-life
problem</DD>

<DT>
3.</DT>

<DD>
the selection of an appropriate numerical technique developed for its solution</DD>

<DT>
4.</DT>

<DD>
the actual implementation or use of a numerical routine, be it in Fortran,
C, Mathematica, Matlab or the like</DD>

<DT>
5.</DT>

<DD>
the evaluation or quality control of the numerical output.</DD>
</DL>
The course is structured in such a way that for each topic all of steps
(1) through (5) are covered, with special attention to the computer science
background of the students. On one hand, special care is taken when choosing
motivating examples so that they are not too technical, yet reasonably
real-life. On the other hand, all the aspects of step (4) are treated in
great detail. Whereas other scientific computing courses exist, this course
is special in that it makes very explicit that one should distinguish between
the properties of a mathematical algorithm and the properties of the algorithm's
implementation in finite precision arithmetic on a computer. Computer science
students are interested in computer arithmetic as part of scientific computing,
in the same way they are interested in learning about compilers in order
to obtain a full understanding of programming languages.
<P>Taking these considerations into account, the course ``Computer Arithmetic
and Numerical Techniques'' consists of two parts, one discussing how computations
are performed on a binary machine as compared to mathematical computations
in the set of real numbers (15-hour course load), and one on different
numerical techniques (30-hour course load). These two parts are now described
in detail. At the end of each part, we also discuss how the students get
hands-on experience.
