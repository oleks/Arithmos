About the authors</H1>
<B>Annie Cuyt</B> is Research Director at the FWO-Vlaanderen,
the Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders, and teaches several computing
courses at the University of Antwerp (UIA), among which the course ``Computer
Arithmetic and Numerical Techniques'' described above. She received her
Doctor Scientia degree in 1982 from the same university. She is the author
of more than 90 publications in international journals and conference proceedings
and the author or editor of several books. Her current interests are in
``Computer Arithmetic'' and in ``Numerical Approximation Theory''. In view
of these interests she is an editorial board member of the new journal
``Reliable Computing''. Since 1997 she also serves as a member on the scientific
committee of the Flemish Science Foundation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Brigitte Verdonk</B> is a postdoctoral fellow at the
FWO-Vlaanderen and is affiliated with the Department of Mathematics and
Computer Science of the University of Antwerp (UIA). She obtained a Master's
degree in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1984 and a Doctor
Scientia degree from the University of Antwerp in 1988. After a few years
in industry, she returned to academic life and is now the author of approximately
30 publications in international journals and proceedings. She is currently
coordinating the development of a programming language environment enabling
the evaluation, with maximal accuracy, of hybrid numeric expressions (hardware
and multi-precision floats, intervals, rationals, ...).
