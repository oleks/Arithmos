Linear algebra</H1>
This subject is of uttermost importance because so many real-life problems
involve the solution of a system of linear equations. Hence the real-life
problems that we discuss come from quite different areas such as
<UL>
<LI>
computer graphics: finding the intersection points of lines and planes</LI>

<LI>
robotics: the movement of a robot can be described by matrix manipulations
(multiplication and inversion) applied to the robot's state vector</LI>

<LI>
approximation theory: computing an approximation for the real number <I>e</I>
by solving a tridiagonal system of linear equations, obtained from computing
the convergents of a continued fraction expansion for <I>e</I>.</LI>
</UL>
All the numerical methods which are discussed in this module are exact
methods: Gaussian elimination (without and with partial pivoting) and <I>QR</I>-factorization.
Having a proper understanding of computer arithmetic, students easily see
that the implementation of an exact method only yields an exact solution
if exact arithmetic is carried out with exact data. Since this is clearly
not the case for any implementation in floating-point arithmetic, notions
like ``rounding error", ``ill-conditioning" and ``numerical stability"
pop up naturally and are discussed thoroughly. Students get hands-on experience
solving different problems, e.g. inverting the Hilbert matrix.
